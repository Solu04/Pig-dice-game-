# Pig (dice game)

## About

<p> I decided to build this intermediate pig dice project game to improve on my DOM manipulation skills</p>

## How to Play

<p> Two players are needed to play the game </p>
<p> Players roll the dice and the dice number gets added to the particular player current score
</p>
<p> Players can choose to hold after rolling the dice the number of times they want </p>
<p> When they hold their current score gets saved and the next dice roll is transferred to the next player </p>
<p> Whenever a player rolls a 'ONE', they loose all their current score and the next dice roll is transferred to the next player </p>
<p> The first player to reach 100 points wins the game 🏆🎉🎉</p>
